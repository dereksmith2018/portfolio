    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <header>Work Experience</header>
       <ul>
         <p>DPR Investments: 2015-2018  I worked as a general manager for the Whatcom County area.
           My main job consisted of ordering and shipping furniture and managing the store location.
           What I learned most about while wprking there is how to manage and bugdet your time. I have had days that, for some reason didn't have enough minutes in the day.
           Planning the time out and completing your work, without taking shortcuts, and making sure the job is done right.
         </p>
         <p>Nordstrom: 2012-2015 I worked in the Asset Retention Department. My day to day job was to look for internal signs of theft from employees.
            There, it reinforced my belief to make sure follow through with your work. Making and managing teams, scheduling meetings, and employee training.</p>
        </ul>
     <header>Education</header>
      <ul>
        <p>I have attended <span>Whatcom Community College</span> and <span>Seattle Central-2018.</span></p>
      </ul>
     <header>A little bit more...</header>
       <ul>
         <p>I have been looking at what I want to do for a long time. I came from Seattle Univeristy to Epicodus.
           I wanted to dive in and get first hand experience, and not waste another year doing filler classes.
           I like being able to work at a pace it like, as well as, making every project ot the best of my abilities.
           From the way that we are learn and interact in class, to the way we pair up,
           you can see that the class is meant to make you learn.
        </p>
